Some old designs i made following tutorials online.
All KiCad projects.
The first one is a Charlie plexing keychain and a 2032 battery holder.
The second one was originally an alarm clock idea that simulated sunrise and sunset with a stackable design. (if ordered from JLCPCB, you would have one full set)
Do whatever you want with them.
